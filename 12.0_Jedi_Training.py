All questions are about the final code in Chapter 12:

1.) Where is the ball's original location?
The center of the window
2.) What are the variables dx and dy?
the X an Y axis
3.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the x-direction?
60* whatever number  you put
4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
60* whatever number you put
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
The movement of the ball in any direction
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
move the ball to the left at 60 pixles per second
7.) What does this code do?  self.pos_y += self.dy
sets the ball to the opposite direction
8.) What is the width of the window?
640 pixles
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
that the ball wont go off the edge, not even alittle.
10.) What is this code checking? if self.pos_x < self.rad
that the ball is not partially over the edge?
